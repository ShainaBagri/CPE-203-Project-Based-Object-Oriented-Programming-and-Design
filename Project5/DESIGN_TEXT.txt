Main Character must be movable with Courser keys:
-A person / Cal Poly Student moves up, down, left, right across the screen in an attempt to get As,
while avoiding Fs and the sickness.

OVERALL ENTITY DESIGN PATTERN:
- Hierarchy of abstract classes with similar functionally being linked together.
- Factory Design Implementation explanation below 

Least 3 different kind of entities where one kind is moving using a "new" pathing algorithm:
-A's (stationary object, created by the professor, on the left-side)
-F's (come down, like a stream in the center of the world in a staggered pattern)
-Person/ Player (movable character, follows commands by users)
-Grade Book (stationary spot, created on the right-side)
-Sickness (follows a variation of the Best First Search Pathing Algorithm to chase the player)

ON MOUSE CLICK :
 - The user chooses a level, and the corresponding game will start

FACTORY DESIGN PATTERN:
 - Factory Design Pattern used to create the different levels of the obstacle which creates different sicknesses.
 - In level 1, the sickness starts from a designated position with the slowest speed.
 - In level 2, the sickness starts from a random position with 3 possible spots and has a medium speed.
 - In level 3, the sickness starts from a random position with 5 possible spots and has the fastest speed.



What each partner was responsible for completing:
 - Both worked equally on everything
 - Both created and added ideas
 - Both documented the code
